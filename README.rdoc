Thank You Note Generator
========================

This is a single page application which generates post interview thank you notes.  It's a MadLibs style app where you fill out the form, then hit the button and get a short, ready to go note to copy and paste.  This is the first react.js application I've built.

App is deployed and can be used [here](https://sheltered-wave-20106.herokuapp.com/)
